# QuizAppSite

Built using an C# .NET backend for an API which retrieves the questions and adds the user results to an SQL database, this is deployed using azure.

React was used for the front end, to send to requests to the API and present the application in a clear, user friendly way.

A potential use case for this would be as a feature for a school site, where students can take the quiz. Potentially as a homework exercise where students must get a minimum score, the teacher can then see the results to verify this is the case.
